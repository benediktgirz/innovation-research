I'm the VP of Product, Platform at [Slack](https://www.slack.com). In the past, I've led product teams at [InVision](https://www.invision.com), [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com), and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com). 

I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife, two young daughters, and an Italian truffle dog that isn't of much use in the city.
