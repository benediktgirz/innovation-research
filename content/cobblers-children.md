Summary: I purchased hirefrank.com nearly 13 years ago. In 2014, I plan on putting it to good use.

I purchased hirefrank.com nearly 13 years ago. I was a junior in college, 
and I was clearly focused on getting a job and graduating, in that order.

It would be 8 months later before I would launch my first site. A then 
senior months before graduation, it would be a portfolio site bolstering 
_my_ much sought after experience (emphasis mine). 

The portfolio site ended up getting me a job at The Washington Post &mdash; 
mostly because the hiring manager found the domain intriguing and felt the 
site was worth a cursory look.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked at Google and Etsy building web products delighting 
(and infuriating at times) countless passionate users. But, I never found the 
time to maintain my personal website beyond a simple "Welcome!" page or until 
more recently a redirect to my about.me profile page.

For the last decade, each year I would renew my domain and daydream about 
content. Sometimes it would be in blog form, other times music or pictures. 
I researched technologies and even switch web hosts seasonally thinking that 
was the missing piece, but knowing full well it wasn't.

I never planned on keeping the domain for as long as I have but at this point 
it seems like a shame to give it up. 

Late last year, I left Etsy to do a [startup](http://getradico.com) with some 
good friends. I now have less time than I've ever had before, but in a weird 
way it seems like the perfect time to collect my thoughts regularly so I don't 
go insane.

And if I don't, it will just make my current employer, me, uneasy, not unlike the 
way my domain made my past employers felt once I had a job.
