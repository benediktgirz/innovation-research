### Liability for Contents

As service providers, we are liable for our own contents of these websites according to Sec. 7, Para. 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz – Tele Media Act by German law). However, pursuant to Sec. 8 to 10 of the TMG, we as service providers are under no obligation to monitor submitted or stored information or to research circumstances pointing to illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, a relevant liability is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of appropriate violations, we will remove the content immediately.

### Liability for Links

Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no control over the contents of those websites, therefore we cannot assume liability for these foreign contents. The provider or administrator of linked pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.

The linked pages were checked for possible violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not discernible at the time of linking. However, a permanent monitoring of the contents of linked pages cannot be expected without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law.

Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The contents and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator.

Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such.

Should you become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. As soon as we become aware of any infringement, we will remove such content immediately.
