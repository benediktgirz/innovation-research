# I'm Benedikt, I love building and growing successful products

I help leaders build impactful products, go to market,
scale teams and shape narratives.

My unfair advantage is having worked in four different roles as
<span class="font-medium">Marketer</span>,
<span class="font-medium">Manager</span>,
<span class="font-medium">Developer</span>,
<span class="font-medium">Educator</span>.

This gives me a unique perspective to understand every step of product development and foster cross-functional collaboration.
