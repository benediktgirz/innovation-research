# Iâ€™m Frank Harris, a product leader turned coach.

I help leaders navigate messy and high-stakes moments of growth like new roles, scaling teams, and evolving strategies.

My coaching is shaped by two decades in the arena at places like <span class="font-medium">Slack</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ™Œ</span>, <span class="font-medium">Etsy</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.0em] inline-block">ðŸ§¶</span>, and <span class="font-medium">Google</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ¤–</span>.

I bring that experience to leaders through [1:1 coaching](/coaching), [Frankbot](https://tryfrank.chat) (my AI assistant), and [Frank Takeaways](https://franktakeaways.com/), my <span class="hidden md:inline-block">mildly entertaining</span> newsletter.
