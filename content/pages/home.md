# Hi, I'm Frank.

A former product executive and angel investor with over 20 years at companies like <span class="font-medium">Slack</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ™Œ</span>, <span class="font-medium">Etsy</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.0em] inline-block">ðŸ§¶</span>, and <span class="font-medium">Google</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ¤–</span>.

I run [a coaching practice](/coaching) dedicated to guiding leaders through the tricky stuff of building products and high-performing teams.

I write [Frank Takeaways](https://franktakeaways.com), a mildly entertaining newsletter about the notes worth keeping.
