  building products and high-performing teams.'

Building products is hard. Leading the people who build them? Harder.

Whether it's stepping into a Staff+ role, managing a growing team, or navigating
founder dynamics, coaching helps leaders move through uncertainty with more
clarity, confidence, and impact.

Frank works with senior ICs, first-time managers, and seasoned VPs across
startups, scale-ups, and public companies &mdash; spanning B2B, B2C, regulated
industries, and high-growth tech. His coaching is grounded in ICF-aligned
principles and shaped by 20+ years of leadership experience at companies like
Slack, Etsy, Google, Betterment, Casper, and InVision.

Sessions are hands-on and reflective, blending structured frameworks, sharp
questions, and metaphor-driven insight to help leaders operate with intention
and grow on purpose.
