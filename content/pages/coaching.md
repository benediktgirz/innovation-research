Building products is hard. Leading the people who build them? Even harder.

Whether it's stepping into a Staff+ role, managing a growing team, or navigating founder dynamics, coaching helps leaders move through uncertainty with more clarity, confidence, and impact.

Frank works with senior ICs, first-time managers, and seasoned VPs at startups, scale-ups, and public companies &mdash; spanning B2B and B2C sectors, regulated industries, and high-growth tech. His coaching is grounded in ICF-aligned principles and shaped by over 20 years of experience leading teams and building products at companies like Slack, Etsy, Google, Betterment, Casper, and InVision.

Sessions are hands-on and reflective while blending structured frameworks, sharp questions, and metaphor-driven insight to help leaders operate with intention and grow on purpose
