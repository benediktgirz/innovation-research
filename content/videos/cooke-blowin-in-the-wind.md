Sam Cooke in 1964, a few months before his death, performing "Blowin' in the
Wind" on the ABC variety show
[Shindig!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shindig!).

From
[NPR's Sam Cooke And The Song That 'Almost Scared Him'](http://www.npr.org/2014/02/01/268995033/sam-cooke-and-the-song-that-almost-scared-him):

> Soon, Cooke was jarred by another civil rights anthem: Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in
> the Wind," which Guralnick says Cooke loved but wished had come from a person
> of color â€” so much so that he incorporated it into his repertoire almost
> immediately.
