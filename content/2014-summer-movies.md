Summary: This is an example of a draft post.

One of the best things &mdash; that I never take full advantage of &mdash; is New York City's penchant for free outdoor movies during the summer.

Based on [Kottke's suggestion](http://kottke.org/14/05/free-outdoor-movies-in-nyc-for-summer-2014), I aggregated over a dozen venues and nearly a hundred movies into a single calendar. Each calendar entry features a brief synopsis, a link to the trailer and the details about the venue.

So far, I've included the following venues:

* Close Encounters of the Spielberg Kind, Museum of Jewish Heritage 
* Hudson River Park's RiverFlicks Big Hit Wednesdays on Pier 63
* Summer on the Hudson: Pier I Picture Show, Riverside Park
* SummerScreen in McCarren Park
* Syfy Movies with a View at Brooklyn Bridge Park 
* Hudson River Park's RiverFlicks Family Fridays on Pier 46 
* Celebrate Brooklyn! at Prospect Park Bandshell
* Sony Wonder Technology Lab Feature Screenings
* Movie Night at Habana Outpost, Brooklyn
* Intrepid Summer Movie Series, Intrepid flight deck
* Movies at Crocheron Park
* HBO Bryant Park Summer Film Festival
* Central Park Conservancy Film Festival

The calendar is available in the following formats:

* [Google Calendar](http://hrfnk.tk/RWBH6u)
* [iCalender](http://hrfnk.tk/1n28wbQ)
* [XML](http://hrfnk.tk/RWBP5X)

I hope to add [Rooftop Films](http://rooftopfilms.com/blog/2014/04/rooftop-films-2014-summer-series-feature-film-lineup.html) soon, but their data is a bit hard and tedious to gather. If you know anyone there, know of any other venues or have any other tips, let me know!

Enjoy the show(s).
