Summary: One calendar with over a dozen venues featuring over 100 free movies to enjoy this summer in the city.

**Updated 5/17/2014:** Added Films on the Green and Front/Row Cinema at South Street Seaport Pier. I've also created a dedicated Twitter account, [@NYCSummerFilms](https://twitter.com/nycsummerfilms) to tweet same day reminders. 

**Further updates will be [captured on this page](http://www.hirefrank.com/14/05/announcing-nycsummerfilms/).**

One of the best things about New York City &mdash; and one that I never take full advantage of &mdash; is the wide array of free outdoor movies during the summer.

Based on [Kottke's suggestion](http://kottke.org/14/05/free-outdoor-movies-in-nyc-for-summer-2014), I aggregated over a dozen venues and <s>nearly</s> more than a hundred movies into a single calendar. Each calendar entry features a brief synopsis, a link to the trailer and details about the venue or series.

The calendar is available in the following formats:

* [Google Calendar](http://hrfnk.us/RWBH6u)
* [iCalendar](http://hrfnk.us/1n28wbQ)
* [XML](http://hrfnk.us/RWBP5X)

Enjoy the show(s).
