A coaching practice dedicated to guiding leaders through the tricky stuff of building products and high-performing teams.

I've spent the last 20+ years leading teams and building products across companies like Slack, Etsy, and Google. As a 5x VP of Product, I've navigated the highs, lows, and everything in between.


Now, I help product leaders take the next step in their journey.

As a coach and advisor, Frank leverages his diverse background to offer unique insights into product development, organizational design, and leadership in tech. He specializes in helping product leaders navigate ambiguity, refine their strategies, and amplify their impact within their organizations.

Frank's approach to coaching is tailored and hands-on, drawing from his experiences leading high-performance software teams and managing products through various stages of growth, including pre-Product Market Fit and IPO processes. His expertise covers a wide range of areas, including product strategy, go-to-market planning, pricing strategies, and organizational design.

With a passion for continuous learning and improvement, Frank embodies the "working title" philosophy, recognizing that even experienced leaders benefit from ongoing refinement of their skills and perspectives.
