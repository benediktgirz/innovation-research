# Hi, I'm Frank. 🙋🏼‍♂️

I'm a Maker, Coach, and Angel Investor with 20+ years of experience leading teams and building products at companies like <span class="font-medium">Slack</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">🙌</span>, <span class="font-medium">Etsy</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.0em] inline-block">🧶</span>, and <span class="font-medium">Google</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">🤖</span>.

In 2024, I launched [Working Titles](/services), a coaching practice dedicated to guiding leaders through the tricky stuff of building products and high-performing teams. As a 5x VP of Product, I've navigated the highs, lows, and everything in between.

I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife, two young daughters, and an Italian truffle dog that isn't of much use in the city.
