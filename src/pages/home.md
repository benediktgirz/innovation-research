# Hi, I'm Frank.

A maker, coach, and angel investor with 20+ years of experience leading teams and building products at companies like <span class="font-medium">Slack</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ™Œ</span>, <span class="font-medium">Etsy</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.0em] inline-block">ðŸ§¶</span>, and <span class="font-medium">Google</span> <span class="relative -top-[0.1em] inline-block">ðŸ¤–</span>.

I run [Working Titles](/services), a coaching practice dedicated to guiding leaders through the tricky stuff of building products and high-performing teams.

As a 5x VP of Product, I've navigated the highs, lows, and everything in between.
