Here's a more detailed summary of the @NYCSummerFilms project for your portfolio:

The @NYCSummerFilms project aimed to create a comprehensive calendar of free outdoor movie screenings taking place across New York City during the summer of 2014. Recognizing that one of the best things about NYC is the abundance of free summer film series, the creator sought to aggregate this information into a single, easily accessible resource.

The project gathered data on over 20 different film series, 30+ venues, 200+ movies, and 230+ showtimes. This information was then compiled into a calendar that could be accessed in various formats, including Google Calendar, iCalendar, and XML. Each calendar entry included a brief synopsis of the film, a link to the trailer, and details about the venue or series hosting the screening.

By consolidating this data into a unified calendar, the @NYCSummerFilms project made it significantly easier for New Yorkers and visitors to discover and plan their attendance at these free outdoor movie events. This project demonstrated the creator's ability to identify a need, gather and organize disparate information, and present it in a user-friendly way that enhances people's access to free cultural experiences in the city.

Overall, the @NYCSummerFilms project showcases skills in data aggregation, calendar integration, information design, and the leveraging of online tools and platforms to share valuable community resources. It highlights the creator's commitment to helping people make the most of the abundant free entertainment offerings in New York City during the summer months.
