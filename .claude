# Project-Specific Context

## Development Server

When starting the development server for this project, always use port 3001:

```bash
deno task lume -s --port 3001
```

This ensures consistency and avoids port conflicts with other running services.

## Multi-Language Development Workflow

This site supports 4 languages: English (en), German (de), French (fr), and Portuguese (pt).

**Important:** When making content or layout changes:

1. **Always develop and test on the English version first** (`content/en/pages/`)
2. **Get user approval** on the English implementation
3. **Only then apply** the same changes to the other language versions (de, fr, pt)

This workflow ensures:
- Faster iteration during development
- Clear testing and approval process
- Consistency across all language versions
- Reduced back-and-forth when changes are needed
