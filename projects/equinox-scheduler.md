#### Easily automate Equinox class reservations with Google Apps Script
Back in 2019, I was an avid fan of Equinox's Precision Run Classes. The class is 45 minutes long and customizes the treadmill's speed, duration, incline, and recovery to your need (think: spin class but for runners). Since there was a limit on the number of treadmills per class, you had to reserve a spot in advance. Reservations open 26 hours before class time -- for early morning classes this means waking up far too early. 

*This project:*
* Reserves classes on your behalf as soon as they open
* Automatically syncs your Equinox Calendar with your Google Calendar
* Adds classes to your Equinox Calendar in advance (so you don't have to do it manually)

In theory, this should work for any class that requires a reservation. Note: I haven't used this in a few years, if something doesn't work -- let me know!
